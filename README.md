# Update Portfolio

## Hosted at: https://thehebi.github.io/updated-portfolio/

### Technologies used:
<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/" target="_blank">Bootstrap 4.6</a>

#### The purpose of this project was to update my portfolio. I chose to start from scratch rather than changing my original portfolio because I wanted to update it with Bootstrap to make it more modern and mobile friendly. My portfolio now shows my four most recent projects, as well as having my resume and contact information at the top of the page.

#### Clicking on the "Contact Me" button at the top of the screen will open a modal with my contact information. Here you will find a link to my LinkedIn profile, my Github profile, my phone number, my email, and my headshot as well.

#### The cards containing my project information all have a screenshot from the project, the name of the project, a short description of the project, and a view button. Clicking on this button will take you to the deployed application.

#### My portfolio has also been formatted to be more mobile friendly as well.
